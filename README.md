# Advanced Initiative
## An initiative module for D&amp;D5E Foundry VTT

# Note: This module is very much a work in progress. Isn't even close to working yet.

This module rewrites the D&D 5th Edition initiative rules in a way based on Mike Mearl's homebrew system.

How the Initiative Works:

Each person has a base initiative of 100 + DEX and subtracts the result of a die. This die depends on the intended action of the player.

Each time a person's round occurs, they are allowed to perform the action stated earlier and decide their targets and the specifics of their action.

After the character's action is completed, they are allowed to choose from their remaining options, roll another die, and get a new round in the initiative.

This provides a fun dynamic initiative system which requires improvisational skills.
